    <p>Welcome to my page! I am a professional Software Developer, Programmer, and iOS Developer who creates programs for kids and adults.
    I started my education in programming as a career transition after teaching and living abroad in South Korea. Due to the nature
    of the COVID-19 pandemic, I though deeply about what direction I wanted to move in professionally and what essential skills I
    wanted to aquire to stay relevant and attractive in the professional sphere. I'd created websites on my own, but never really had
    a strong foundation in coding.  Nonetheless, it interested me and fed my creative inclinations.  After committing time each day
    to online courses in coding and programming, I landed an incredible position as a software engineer with Disney. I've introduced and
    created innovative programs and assisted with projects to push forward the future of programming technologies. I am also the creator of
    Shark Spell, an interactive educational game.</p>
